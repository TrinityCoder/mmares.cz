The [`language-cmake`][1] package had been the most used CMake
syntax highlighter for [Atom][2]. However, the package
was discontinued in May 2019, approximately corresponding
to CMake v3.14.

## My `language-cmake-2` fork
I have [forked the project][3] and updated it to the current
CMake version (3.19.2). I also plan to keep it up-to-date
in the future.
